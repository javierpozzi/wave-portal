# Wave Portal

Wave Portal is a dApp where you can greet me ðŸ‘‹ and send me a message. The data will be stored on the ethereum blockchain, and there is a random chance you can win a small amount of ETH!

Made with Solidity, Hardhat and React. It was intended for educational purpose.

Based on the "Build a Web3 App with Solidity + Ethereum Smart Contracts" project of [buildspace](https://buildspace.so/).
